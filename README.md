# python_app_framework
A flexible framework for python script command-line applications. Easy to subclass, test, etc. - for my personal use but use it if you want.

This also includes my initialize_logging() function. It sets up a slightly more complex logging than the basic, but nothing too complex. It can act as a pseudo-singleton, and can be extended pretty easily.
